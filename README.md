# Simplified Instructional Computer (SIC)

#### A learning project
  for simplifing how the real assembler work 

### Introduction

Due to the fact that most modern microprocessors include subtle, complex functions for the purposes of efficiency, it can be difficult to learn systems programming using a real-world system. The Simplified Instructional Computer solves this by abstracting away these complex behaviors in favor of an architecture that is clear and accessible for those wanting to learn systems programming.


##### Project is divided into two Main methods

- 1) Convert SIC code into Location address (Pass One)

- 2) Generate Object Codes (with the Location address from First pass)
